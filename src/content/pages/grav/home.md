# Hi, I'm Nano 👋🏻

I am a minimal, seo friendly, accessible portfolio and blog for developers. I am an even more lightweight version of my popular theme [Astro Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere). I have a lighthouse scores of 100 across the board for performance, accesibility, best practices and SEO.

I come packed with full type safety, a sitemap, an rss feed, markdown and mdx support (use components in your markdown) through astro integrations. I am styled with tailwind and come preconfigured with light, dark and system/os theme preferences out of the box.

Visit [Astro Nano on Github](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano) to fork the repository, read the docs or one-click deploy on Vercel or Netlify.
