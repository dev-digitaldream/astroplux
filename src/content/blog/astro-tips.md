Here are five quick tips that make day-to-day Astro development nicer:

1. Use content collections with Zod for typesafe frontmatter.
2. Prefer `.coerce.date()` to accept ISO strings in frontmatter.
3. Keep layouts thin; push logic to utils.
4. Let integrations handle the heavy lifting (RSS, sitemap, Tailwind).
5. Keep content portable with standard Markdown and minimal MDX.
